**Project: Document Verification DApp**

This repository contains an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a document verification system.

To simulate uploading an actual document, this app will use some document details given as input by the user.

A researcher can hash and digitally sign a document and then add this information to a smart contract. Peers can retrieve the hash and digital signature from the smart contract and use it to decode the researcher's digital identity to verify who had signed it.

The DAPP can be deployed to truffle:

Versions:

1. Truffle v5.5.3
2. Metamask v10.10.2
3. NodeJS v16.14.0

Instructions on how to migrate the contract and import test accounts from Truffle can be found below.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

## Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running.

Clone this repository:

```
git clone <repository>
```

Change directory to ```DocumentVerification``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd DocumentVerification
npm init
```

In a separate terminal window, launch and compile smart contracts:

```
truffle develop
truffle compile
```

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to development network (please make sure to uncomment network settings in truffle-config.js):

```
truffle migrate --network development
```

In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:

```
cd DocumentVerification
cd app
npm run dev
```

On Metamask, import a private key from the list of private keys generated by Truffle.
